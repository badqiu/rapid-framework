o  what about jdbc 2 back support??

o  configuration that doesn't rely on system properties (jdbc parms?)

o  PostLogProfilerProcessor needs to be able to handle exceptions in log, & needs to be more efficient, also needs command
   line switches to control the thresholds & counts, etc.
   
o  intelligent array dumper?

o  check for more different kinds of JDBC drivers at startup time

o  support for data sources

o  ALL String concatenation & dumping methods should take place ONLY if logging is ON!!

o  review dumpedSql method - make auto line breaking option (& num chars used) be options

o  need log4jdbc.debug.stack.regex so that the stack matching can take place via regex

o  maven2 repository support

o  this may be a better solution to SimpleDateFormat contention issue:  http://www.javaspecialists.eu/archive/Issue172.html
